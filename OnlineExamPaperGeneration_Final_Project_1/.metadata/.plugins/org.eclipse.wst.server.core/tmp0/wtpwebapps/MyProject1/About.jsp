			<h1>About us</h1>
			<p class="text">Traditionally, composing examination papers is
				done manually by using the writer'8s knowledge, experience and
				style. Despite the high credit of the questions, there are still
				some shortcomings. The main problem is a low quality of papers
				caused by some human factors such as instability and relatively
				narrow range of topics.Teachers need to spend a lot of time and
				energy in composing examination papers. This does nothing for the
				separation of teaching and testing. Therefore, with the use of
				computers, automatic generation of test papers is an important
				measure for achieving the separation of teaching.</p>
